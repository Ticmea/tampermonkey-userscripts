# Start "My Mix"

Start "My Mix" is a userscript that aims to allow the user to start YouTubes "My Mix" Playlist manually.

It does so by registering two Menu Items that redirect the user there when clicked.
(One to start from the current video if available, the other to start from a 0 second video)

You can find this script ready for install at: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/565457-youtube-start-my-mix
