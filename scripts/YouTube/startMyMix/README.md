# Start "My Mix"

Start "My Mix" is a userscript that aims to allow the user to start YouTubes "My Mix" and "Mix - [video title]" Playlists manually.

It registers two Menu Items that redirect the user to "My Mix" when clicked.
(One to start from the current video if available, the other to start from a 0 second video)

It also registers a Menu Item that redirects the user to "Mix - [video title]" (from the current video) when clicked.

The two items that redirect to a list from the current video are only registered if at the time of executing the user script, a video is currently selected.
